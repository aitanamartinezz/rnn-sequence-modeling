# Sequence Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

This repository contains the implementation of deep learning models based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling tasks. The project explores
recurrent architectures and training strategies using Python and deep learning
libraries.

## Project Overview

Recurrent Neural Networks are designed to model sequential data by capturing
temporal dependencies between elements in a sequence. This project focuses on
building, training, and evaluating RNN-based models to learn patterns in sequential
data.

The implementation provides a practical overview of recurrent neural networks
and their behavior when applied to sequence-based problems.
